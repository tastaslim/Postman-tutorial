Typescript is a superset of javascript. Files with .ts extensions are written in Typescript.
It means any valid code of js is a valid code for ts.

Typescript=Javascriptstatic typing+types+ compile time check+more features;
It basically deals with all the problems of javascript. it is an OOPS language like c# or java, developed 
and maintained by Microsoft which supports classes, interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism etc.
Any .ts files is first compiled and then it gets converted to .js file and then it runs anywhere. Because browsers
only understands javascript.
Unlike c++ or java here types are written after varibale in Typescript. eg:(age:number)

We can define our own types in Typescript as well in .d.ts files and import them and use them.
